        <p>Friday night my baby sister went to my cousins a few miles away to babysit for the night. She comes home frantic around 11pm and explains some jerk side swiped her car on her way home. This guy gets out to check and make sure she is ok, then jumps in his car and leaves. If I ever find this guy you can imagine I will have a few choice words for the kind of scumbag that he is. Thankfully my sister calmed down and she was not hurt in anyway. The car was already a little dinged up and the new damage is not terrible, just another eyesore.</p>
<p>Sorry for quality of photo’s. These were taken that night at 11:30pm in the rain.</p>
