        <p>Leah said it was burger night, so might as well do it right. Bought a ribeye steak, then sliced it up and cut off the excess fat and tissue (leave some of the fat, otherwise you get a dry burger). Formed patties, seasoned it with salt and old bay. Wrap it with bacon. Place on grill.</p>
<p>Once its nearly done, grill your buns and top burgers with cheese. Leave burgers in until the cheese is molten, and dripping into the fire. Place on bun, add as much sauce as you want (add more later, too much will soggy the bun, but mine was a little dry in the middle so I added more halfway through).</p>
<p>Damn near one of the best burgers I have ever had, definitely restaurant grade.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
