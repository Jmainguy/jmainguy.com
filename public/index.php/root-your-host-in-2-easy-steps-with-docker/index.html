        <p>So lets assume jmainguy is a user on your system, and he asks to be added to the docker group so he can spin up docker containers and such, seems like a fairly reasonable request. You add him to the docker group.</p>
<p>jmainguy then complains that he cant share data among-st his containers via -v volume mounting, selinux is stopping him. He wanted to mount some gluster storage shared between the containers, a fairly reasonable request. For some reason you turn off selinux so he can volume mount. (dont turn off selinux).</p>
<p>You have now given jmainguy root to the box.</p>
<p>I did not feel like becoming root on my laptop, so I updated it via the following as my jmainguy user in the docker group.</p>
<p>docker run -v /:/home -ti fedora /bin/bash</p>
<p>#This mounted / from the host, to /home on the container, and then dropped jmainguy into the container running bash (as root on the container).</p>
<p>as root, I ran chroot /home #This makes shell act like / starts at /home basically.</p>
<p>then because I hate /bin/sh, I ran /bin/bash</p>
<p>Hooray, I am full root on my laptop and can do as I please. Thankfully I just wanted to upgrade it</p>
<p>dnf upgrade.</p>
<p>And as root on the container looking at dnf history, it shows this.</p>
<p>[root@Jmainguy-Fedora jmainguy]# dnf history</p>

<p>As you can see, ID2 27, the user was “System <!-- raw HTML omitted -->” and updated 83 packages.</p>
<p>tldr; Do not turn off selinux</p>
<p>Credit <a href="http://reventlov.com/advisories/using-the-docker-command-to-root-the-host">http://reventlov.com/advisories/using-the-docker-command-to-root-the-host</a> for inspiring me to try this. I was unable to duplicate his trick of copying /bin/sh to the host and using that to become root, but it relied on volume mounting as this does, so pretty much the same thing.</p>
