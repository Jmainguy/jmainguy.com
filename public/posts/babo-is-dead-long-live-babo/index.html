        <p>It is the end of an era, today I have shut off the &ldquo;master&rdquo; server for <a href="https://www.baboviolent.net/">baboviolent 2</a>, that people could connect to and see other babo servers to play on. BV2 was a really fun top down shooting game where the characters were balls that rolled around. I enjoyed playing it as much as I enjoyed hosting it in the latter years. I have very fond memories of playing on =TM= with Size, Deathreay and the rest, as well as (tb) with Allen and the gang. I was very immature and quite the prick when I played though, and I feel bad for the way I treated my teammates and opponents. I was consumed with winning, and I was a bad leader, in that I did not build up my fellow teammembers and help them become they best they could be. This is why, despite being a pretty good player, not many clans would want to recruit me. All this to say, I am sorry for the way I acted when I was actively playing, and I strive to do better going forward.</p>
<p>With BV2 being dead, it is actually more alive than ever. NoMercy and the team have recreated it with the Unreal Engine, and it is called <a href="https://www.baboviolent.net/BrutalGrounds">Brutal Grounds</a> The old gang is back on Discord, and the game is very fun with quite a number of new weapons and mechanics. Thank you to the Brutal Grounds team for keeping this fantastic genre alive.</p>
