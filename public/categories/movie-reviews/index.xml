      <description>As usual watching Netflix and I was cruising the Indie section as sometimes they have a good gem in there, I came across RSO and decided to give it a shot. This movie is a Mockumentary and starts off interviewing the main character who is a sex offender. He is almost like-able in the beginning interview and seems like a normalish person, however throughout the rest of the movie you could care less about him and your waiting for the point of the movie where he will make a change for the better.</description>
