      I have been enjoying writing golang applications for a few years now, and I naively assumed other people who wanted to use them could easily build the apps with instructions I provided easy enough.
I discovered that the differences between operating systems is enough that compiling the applications can be burdensome for others. My buddy @slm (hes kind of a big deal) mentioned I should check out goreleaser and I am glad I did.

      I have recently started hobbying with pawn shop guitars, found this LTD a few months ago for $100, noticed it had Seymour Duncans humbucking pickups installed. The guitar was going for $300 new, but I see it now on amazon for $245. My rule of thumb is used gear is worth about 50% of new price, so $100 is already a good deal, add on upgraded pickups and I jumped at the deal.

      My earliest memory of reverence for the flag, was seeing it flying on a huge pole in front of my Grandpa&#8217;s house. We would go see him once a year for thanksgiving and my cousins would come as well, was always a really good time. pulling up and seeing that flag meant we had arrived from the long 12 hour trip (a lifetime for a van full of kids and tiger electronic handheld games).

Casey Weldon, and Amp Lee tear up the Tulane Defense all game, doing anything they want. 31 points before getting pulled at the end of the third.
Brad Johnson comes in at the beginning of the 4th. A pick bounces off a receiver and into the hands of a defender, not the QB&#8217;s fault. Next drive Brad completes a TD pass to one of the tight ends. Marking 4 TE touchdowns in this game.

      My pastor was looking for a sms survey service, requirements: A number to give out, a way to gather the responses, easy to use, cheap as possible. Googling turned up a few results with no clear pricing and salesmen, one I found was about $50 a month. Since I work at a telephone company, I decided just to make one using our API.
I am calling the application &#8220;Survey Hail&#8221;, as its a survey service, and a play of words on the pastors name.

      I recently started watching old school football games, so I figured I would write a review while I am at it. I love the Noles, so I will be watching their games.
The year is 1991, FSU is preseason ranked #1 in the nation, and has for some reason, opted to open the year at a &#8220;neutral&#8221; site in Anaheim California, Disneyland, against the Heisman trophy winner, Ty Detmer lead #19 BYU Cougars.

      Stole most of the recipe from http://allrecipes.com/recipe/239871/toms-scrambled-egg-sandwich/. Fry 3 strips of bacon, leave grease in pan, set cooked bacon aside. put two pieces of bread in toaster. Mix 2 eggs, a little more than a splash of milk, handful of shredded cheddar cheese, salt, and old bay in a bowl until it all comes together. pour into frying pan ontop of the grease and leave it alone. Once its done cooking on one side try and and flip it, fail and settle some of it shredding, attempt to cook on other side.

      Leah said it was burger night, so might as well do it right. Bought a ribeye steak, then sliced it up and cut off the excess fat and tissue (leave some of the fat, otherwise you get a dry burger). Formed patties, seasoned it with salt and old bay. Wrap it with bacon. Place on grill.
Once its nearly done, grill your buns and top burgers with cheese. Leave burgers in until the cheese is molten, and dripping into the fire.

Lots of wood to keep the temp as high as I can get it (gauge only goes to 700, so above that).

Got home and cut up the chuck into small enough chunks to form a patty.Only used one of these and wrapped the rest. Made two patties easy. Nice and fatty.
Cooked the bacon first, so I could add it to the burger later, and hopefully get some grease in the pan for the burgers to cook in (turkey bacon let me down)Leah loves turkey bacon, didn&#8217;t produce any grease for cooking the burger like I was hoping for.

      So I just finished wasting 3 hours of my life trying to get a docker image to run on Redhats PAAS openshift online, and I failed. In short, you can push a docker image to openshift, but it ignores most of the directives in the Dockerfile and rewrites them as it pleases. It then runs the image as any user it wants, and you cant change that, because you are not a open shift admin, on account of using their PAAS instead of running it yourself.

      So lets assume jmainguy is a user on your system, and he asks to be added to the docker group so he can spin up docker containers and such, seems like a fairly reasonable request. You add him to the docker group.
jmainguy then complains that he cant share data among-st his containers via -v volume mounting, selinux is stopping him. He wanted to mount some gluster storage shared between the containers, a fairly reasonable request.

      With sinatrarb you can create a quick web app in ruby very easily, their documentation is great.
http://www.sinatrarb.com/intro.html
One thing you can do, is send a file, like say a tar file.
send_file &#8220;certs/#{filename}/#{filename}.tar&#8221;, :filename =&gt; &#8220;#{filename}.tar&#8221;
I was hosting this on openshift which has a hard drive limitation of 1gb, so I needed to cleanup after each send. Turns out, you cannot simply place FileUtils.rm_rf(&#8216;directorypath/name&#8217;) after send_file to do the job.

      I am pysched for tonights game, the first step towards our dominance of the AFC East. However Let me say a few things about our team.
 Ryan Tannehill is a mediocre wide receiver, his backup is a winner, not a Dan Marino but the best QB we have is Matt Moore, he should be starting.
 Jeff Ireland is an idiot, who makes idiotic choices. We need him gone yesterday.

      So you want to run windows .exe&#8217;s on your shiny Linux server, time to catch mono.
To install mono first install your dependencies.
yum install bison gettext glib2 freetype fontconfig libpng libpng-devel libX11 libX11-devel glib2-devel libgdi* libexif glibc-devel urw-fonts java unzip gcc gcc-c++ automake autoconf libtool make bzip2 wget cd /usr/local/src  wget http://download.mono-project.com/sources/mono/mono-3.0.1.tar.bz2  tar jxf mono-3.0.1.tar.bz2  cd mono-3.0.1  ./configure --prefix=/opt/mono  make && make install  Congrats, you now have Mono installed and can run some Windows .

So to get your website to post to Facebook, you have to create a dev account with Facebook. They require you to add a valid call phone or credit card, seems pretty anoying. After that you create a app (click a few buttons no coding needed) and get the api code.

      The web team asked me to help out on two projects yesterday, it was a ton of fun. The first project was to a 301 redirect working for the Iowa Hawkshop, they needed this to preserve their SEO ranking.
I was able to figure out we could use the Apache mod_rewrite to handle these requests.
The second task was to get rotating images on a timer with alt text via javascript.

      Church had a picnic last night, ended up heading out there around 6pm. We setup the lawn chairs we bought for the last picnic and settled in for a good time. There was a local band playing on the acoustic guitar and congo, cute kids and puppies running around, and good ol fashion corn hole. I ended up getting a few in the hole but our team lost pretty bad. Ate 2 chili dogs and some potato salad, topped off with a few chips a hoy cookies.

Day 1. Spent the day replanting my crops, mining rocks from the mine, turning said rocks into bricks, using said bricks to repair house and fences. After that I went adventuring and found a Champion Dog, a Champion Cave Bug, a Slow Deer, a Raging Deer, a Sly Dog, a Hardened Dog, and 3-4 Scared Unicorns, which I tamed and brought back home.

      Friday night a little after 6 the rndlabs.ca servers for baboviolent 2 went down, and they haven&#8217;t come back up yet. this is the longest period of time that they have been done in the last three years. Over its history the servers where first provided by the creators dZb and Daivuk, then when they didnt want to pay for servers for a free game Vamp stepped up and paid for about a year, then Deathray took over when Vamp got sick of doing it, and now?

      In the last 30 days I have spent $1,433.19 on stuff other then rent, 24 percent on grocerys, 19 perent on games and movies, 16 percent on gasoline, 12 percent on fast food, and 22 percent on phone bill (we got new phones). hopefully next month we will do better, I think I will try and set a budget and see how we do. The current budget being if we have cash, spend it.

      Well I am proud that I have gotten this far, I have completed a Home page, a page dedicated to babo, and now this blog. However I still have a ways to go, I need to get the email server up and running which is proving to be a major headache, I also need to adjust this blog to resemble the rest of the website, as of right now it looks entirely different and impossible to get back to the main page of the website.

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      As usual watching Netflix and I was cruising the Indie section as sometimes they have a good gem in there, I came across RSO and decided to give it a shot. This movie is a Mockumentary and starts off interviewing the main character who is a sex offender. He is almost like-able in the beginning interview and seems like a normalish person, however throughout the rest of the movie you could care less about him and your waiting for the point of the movie where he will make a change for the better.
