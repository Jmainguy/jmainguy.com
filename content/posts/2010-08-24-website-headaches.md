Well I am proud that I have gotten this far, I have completed a Home page, a page dedicated to babo, and now this blog. However I still have a ways to go, I need to get the email server up and running which is proving to be a major headache, I also need to adjust this blog to resemble the rest of the website, as of right now it looks entirely different and impossible to get back to the main page of the website. The contact page will be easy enough to complete once the email server is running, I will take down the review tab and change it to an email tab. The friends tab should be easy to make, a picture of said friend with a link to their blog. Â A lot of work but its all free so thats good =)
