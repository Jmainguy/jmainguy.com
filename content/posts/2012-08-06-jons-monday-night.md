The Hall of Fame NFL game was this past weekend, and I missed it (Was helping a buddy move). So tonight I had to do 2 things before I could relax after a hard day.

1. Configure OpenVPN on my German node so I can browse the internet as your average German would.

2. Buy the Euro NFL Game Pass online streaming package so I can watch my Dolphins all year (Superbowl for sure this year).

OpenVPN wasn&#8217;t as easy as I remembered it, last time I used a great guide from BuyVM, however they deleted it. So after struggeling through multiple guides and bringing down the node completely once, I found a guide that made alot of sense and worked the first time I tried it.

After shelling out $200 to Roger Goodell I am now watching the Hall of Fame game in HD on the computer.  Go Phins

EDIT:

Got tired of the ugly link structure on the site, added mod rewrite to lighttpd following this guide <http://emil.haukeland.name/webservers/2010/url-rewriting-for-wordpress-and-lighttpd/> very well written, Thank you Emil.
