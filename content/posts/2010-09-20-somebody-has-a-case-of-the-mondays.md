Weekend went pretty well, saw the folks, went to a party, and Notch broke Minecraft again, however he has it working today so my server regulars should be happy. I also installed Sockso on the server so I can stream my music to any browser / operating system I want. Listening to my home collection at work is pretty fun. if any Mainguys would like to listen to my collection let me know and I will make you an account.

&#8212;Edit&#8212;

Nope Notch still hasn&#8217;t fixed it, he says maybe tomorrow now. Lame
