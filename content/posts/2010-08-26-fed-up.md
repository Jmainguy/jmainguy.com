In the last 30 days I have spent $1,433.19 on stuff other then rent, 24 percent on grocerys, 19 perent on games and movies, 16 percent on gasoline, 12 percent on fast food, and 22 percent on phone bill (we got new phones). hopefully next month we will do better, I think I will try and set a budget and see how we do. The current budget being if we have cash, spend it.
