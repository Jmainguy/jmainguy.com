Today I was lucky enough to be able to chase the cheese truck. If you work at a cool place, they will have the cheese truck come to your place around lunch time. Redhat did that for us almost a year ago, and I got hooked on [#AmericanMeltdown][1]. Their Buffalo Blitz sandwich is phenomenal. It is basically a grilled cheese with buffalo chicken in the middle. I get the horseradish chips and the best soda in the world to go along with it, good times. Today they were only about 15 mintues away so I booked it over there, and got to give a Jeep the double gun solute on the way there. Today was a good day.
