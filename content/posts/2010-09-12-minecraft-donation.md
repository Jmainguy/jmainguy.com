About two days ago I asked the people who frequent my servers if they could donate a small amount so I could buy a Minecraft account and not have to borrow from Titans. To my surprise within one hour I had three donations that totaled exactly what I needed, Thank you very much to the people who donated. C Jaworski-Leeuwis, Niki ch, and Cynthia Stickle.
