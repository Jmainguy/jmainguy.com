So I have been spending alot of time on the Minecraft server lately, got a google maps image of the server to update every night, Implemented a currency system into the server. And two more people have generoussly donated to buying a new physical server. I think I will save the donations up for a 6 core computer I know I can build for $500.00 however by the time I get to that mark I am sure it will be even more beast then that. Thank you so much Matt Palmer and Joshua Venning for donating this week.
