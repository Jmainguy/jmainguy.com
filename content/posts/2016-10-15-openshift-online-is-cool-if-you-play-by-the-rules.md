So my good buddy Andrew Butcher @akbutcher took pity on me and pointed me in the right direction. After rebuilding the docker container on the assumption that any random user could be running it, it worked like a charm. See the updated code at https://github.com/Jmainguy/docker_images/tree/master/etherpad and launch your own openshift-online version of etherpad.
