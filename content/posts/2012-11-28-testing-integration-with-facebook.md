I rejoined facebook to boost the ol SEO. This is a test to see if integation with facebook is working.

So to get your website to post to Facebook, you have to create a dev account with Facebook. They require you to add a valid call phone or credit card, seems pretty anoying. Â After that you create a app (click a few buttons no coding needed) and get the api code. Install a plugin on your wordpress blog such as &#8220;Add link to Facebook&#8221; and configure it with your api details from Facebook. Done.
