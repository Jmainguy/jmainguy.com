Church had a picnic last night, ended up heading out there around 6pm. We setup the lawn chairs we bought for the last picnic and settled in for a good time. There was a local band playing on the acoustic guitar and congo, cute kids and puppies running around, and good ol fashion corn hole. I ended up getting a few in the hole but our team lost pretty bad. Ate 2 chili dogs and some potato salad, topped off with a few chips a hoy cookies. It was a fun time, its nice to do something instead of in the house all the time.
