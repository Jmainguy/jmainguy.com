Our negotiations with the first house fell through, the owner was not living in reality and thought his house was worth tax value. 

However we really love the house we saw yesterday and placed  a bid on that one, it has everything we are looking for and wont need any work to move in. Lord clearly did not want us to have the last house for a reason. Excited!!
