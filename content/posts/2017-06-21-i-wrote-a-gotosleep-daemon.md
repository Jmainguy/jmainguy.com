I watch youtube / twitch at night to go to sleep to. I am too lazy to open a command line and say shutdown in 120 minutes or so. So instead I wrote a tool, which reads a config, and shuts down at the time specified every night.

Currently only works on Linux as that&#8217;s what I use, and I doubt anybody else will use this.
