Sorry about that, Worked on server admin stuff all week, went over my bandwith cap by about 50gb, comcast will prolly send me a letter saying so. Working on automating server restart and backups, also working on php secure login page for the website and then hosting guest accounts for minecraft. Also playing NCAA 11 on my ps3 a little more, figured out a play that works and I run it non stop, still much harder game then NCAA 09. I have lost 3 times already and that is with me playing the game like 5 times and then deciding I cant beat that team and accepting the loss. thats about it
