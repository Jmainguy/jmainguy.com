Ok so the forum was actually ridiculously easy to set up after all, downloaded the software, followed the installation guide, then placed the folders inside the index Apache looks at. it loaded right up and I could finish the install from the Easton computer. pretty cool stuff, now if only the Email server would be that easy.
