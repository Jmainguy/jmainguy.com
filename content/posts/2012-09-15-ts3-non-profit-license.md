The community Teamspeak server has been full lately and we do not want anyone to miss out on the action. Tonight we applied for a Non profit license which will enable us to host up to 512 members over 10 private servers (So we will never be full again =). Cross your fingers.

[Update] Teamspeak has granted the license, we can host up to 512 slots now. We had some issues with the VPS provider in Kansas and have moved the server to California with BuyVM. The new hostname to connect to the server with is msflights.jmainguy.com to better reflect the current community.
