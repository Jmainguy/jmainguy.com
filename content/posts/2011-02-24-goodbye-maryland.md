Tomorrow will be my last day as an Employed individual, and Saturday will be my last day as a Maryland resident. I am North Carolina bound, the wife and I will be moving to Garner NC to save up some money, we hope to buy a house within the next two years. Â I will also pursue my dream of a full time career in the Information Technology field. I also might start a VPS reseller business, but I am not sure atm.
