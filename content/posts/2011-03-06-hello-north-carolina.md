It has been a week since we moved to Garner and it has been a great week, the weather is awesome, the apartment is awesome, all the shops within 5 minutes of us is awesome, and it has been great to hang out with my cousins and their family. I also landed a contract job that I will start on Tuesday. So far everything has been going great and it looks like the move was a good idea.
