Got nostalgic, installed retro-pi on my raspberry pi and been playing Pokemon Red on it. It is not as good as I remembered it. First, despite being for the Game Boy Color, its not in color. WTF? Second, you cannot bind a key to an item or move, like say I want select to be the bicycle, or select to be the cut move to cut down bushes, nope. Third, Pokebox&#8217;s get full? why? Why do I have to login to a computer, tell it to switch to an open pokebox before I can catch more pokemon, zero automation for pokeboxes. In the newer games, a little pokeball appears next to a pokemon in combat if you already have them, not so much in the original. You just have to try and remember that you caught this one already.
